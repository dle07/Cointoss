top 21 tickers by trade volume scraper list

curl -X "GET"  http://127.0.0.1:5000/highest-volume?limit=15 


For my updates this week I implemented an endpoint that gives yields the n most popular
tickers by trade volume.This data is intended for use for the front page heatmap.
There wasn't a free API that gives us this information so the endpoint scrapes 
the data from a website. The portion of it can be seen on the right.

In addition to this I talked to Jason about the backend endpoints for frontend-backend
integration
